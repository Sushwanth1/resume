Subject: Bank Statement and Billing Address for EAP Reimbursement

Dear [Finance Team or Contact Name],

Thank you for your response.

I would like to clarify that I do not have a credit card, so the training center made the payment directly on my behalf, and I reimbursed them in cash. I have attached the bank statement showing the cash withdrawal I made on [Date], which corresponds to the payment.

Additionally, I requested the training center to generate the billing address in the company's name, and I can provide that documentation if needed.

Please let me know if you require any further information or documentation to proceed with the reimbursement.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance.
